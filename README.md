<!-- * Hints on functionality to implement:
  * Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
  * Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use the Gemfile to manage your gems
  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
  * Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.

* **WARNING** think twice before you push your mobile number or any private details to a public space like Github. Now is a great time to think about security and how you can keep your private information secret. You might want to explore environment variables.

* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am


In code review we'll be hoping to see:



Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance will make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend. -->


## Project title

This is the takeaway challenge, a week(end) 2 project from Makers Academy, used to develop my skills as a junior developer over the weekend of week 2 at Makers Academy Bootcamp. 

```
                            _________
              r==           |       |
           _  //            |  M.A. |   ))))
          |_)//(''''':      |       |
            //  \_____:_____.-------D     )))))
           //   | ===  |   /        \
       .:'//.   \ \=|   \ /  .:'':./    )))))
      :' // ':   \ \ ''..'--:'-.. ':
      '. '' .'    \:.....:--'.-'' .'
       ':..:'                ':..:'

 ```

## Motivation

This project was made to develop Ruby and software development skills.

I am to have:
> All tests pgit stassing
> High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
> The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.


## Build status

The project is currently under construction, it may not be completed as this is a practice exercise to build myskills.  

## Testing 

XXXXXXX the project has XXXXX Test Coverage. 

TDD was used to bulid the project with Rspec. 

## Customer story

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered

## Code style

Rubocop 0.65.0 was used for linting and stylying the Ruby code. 
 
## Screenshots

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX I maybe want to include photos of the class diagrams and system diagrams here?

## Tech/framework used

Ruby was used as the main language, with RSpec used for testing. 

## Features

> Used double to create a menu object in the takeaway rspec to simulate the object and encapsulate the code. 
> 
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

## Installation

Ruby v 2.5.0 was used in the construction of the project, if gems were used, please find attached a gem file listing those gems for installation. 

## API Reference

No API used in this project. 

## Tests

A TDD process was used in the development of this project, please see the attached RSpec files for details of the testing that was carried out. 

## How to use?

You should be able to run the code via irb. 

## Contribute

No contributions are required at this time, as this is a training exercise.
